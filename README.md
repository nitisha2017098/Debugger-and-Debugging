# Debugger-and-Debugging

## Debugging 
Debugging refers to the process of identifying and fixing errors, bugs, and defects in software code.

It is an important skill for software developers and involves analyzing code,

identifying the root cause of the problem, and implementing a solution to fix it.

**Here are some general steps for debugging:**

1. Reproduce the problem: Try to reproduce the error or bug by following the same steps that caused it.

2. Isolate the problem: Narrow down the scope of the problem to isolate the specific section of code that is causing the error.

3. Check the logs: Look at the error messages, console logs, and any other relevant output to see if they provide any clues about the problem.

4. Use debugging tools: Utilize debugging tools such as debuggers, profilers, and code analyzers to help pinpoint the root cause of the problem.

5. Test the fix: After implementing a solution, test it thoroughly to ensure that the problem has been resolved and that no new issues have been introduced.

**Note : Debugging is an iterative process, and it may take several rounds of testing and fixing to fully resolve the issue.**


## Debugger
A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program used to test and debug other programs 
(the "target" program). The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under 
controlled conditions that permit the programmer to track its execution and monitor 
changes in computer resources that may indicate malfunctioning code. Typical debugging 
facilities include the ability to run or halt the target program at specific points, 
display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices (such as disk drives), 
and modify memory or register contents in order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of faulty program execution.

**FEATURES**

Typically, debuggers offer a query processor, a symbol resolver, an expression interpreter, and a debug support interface at its top level. 
Debuggers also offer more sophisticated functions such as running a program step by step (single-stepping or program animation), stopping (breaking) (pausing the program to examine the current state) at some event or specified instruction by means of a breakpoint, and tracking the values of variables. 
Some debuggers have the ability to modify program state while it is running. It may also be possible to continue execution at a different location in the program to bypass a crash or logical error.

The same functionality which makes a debugger useful for correcting bugs allows it to be used as a software cracking tool to evade copy protection, digital rights management, and other software protection features. It often also makes it useful as a general verification tool, fault coverage, and performance analyzer, especially if instruction path lengths are shown. 
Early microcomputers with disk-based storage often benefitted from the ability to diagnose and recover corrupted directory or registry data records, to "undelete" files marked as deleted, or to crack file password protection.


### Here are some popular open-source debugging tools:

1. GDB (GNU Debugger): A powerful debugger that allows you to debug C, C++, and other languages.

2. LLDB: A debugger that supports multiple programming languages, including C, Objective-C, and Swift.

3. Chrome DevTools, 
4. Progress Telerik Fiddler,  
5. SonarLint, 
6. Data Display Debugger, 
7. Froglogic Squish, 
8. Percepio Tracealyzer, 
9. TotalView HPC Debugging Software, and Rollbar.




### Debugging tools of VS CODE

+ One of the key features of Visual Studio Code is its great debugging support. 
VS Code's built-in debugger helps accelerate your edit, compile, and debug loop.

### Debugger extensions
VS Code has built-in debugging support for the Node.js runtime and can debug JavaScript, 
TypeScript, or any other language that gets transpiled to JavaScript.

For debugging other languages and runtimes (including PHP, Ruby, Go, C#, Python, 
C++, PowerShell and many others), look for Debuggers extensions in the VS Code 
Marketplace or select Install Additional Debuggers in the top-level Run menu.


**Below are several popular extensions which include debugging support:**
